Fun little program as I start to learn functions
I am learning Python via the Helsinki MOOC and just now learning about functions so I decided to have some fun.

In this project, I practiced:
- Writing functions
- Using `return` instead of `print`
- Passing user input into a function
- Using a loop to keep asking for input
- learned I can use emojis in Python!

I'm just starting to learn how to organize my code and get used to Visual Studio Code and GitHub.

üê± "Feed us now, mother!" should be added as that is a common thought amongst my kitty crew =P
